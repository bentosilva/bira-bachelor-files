Okie dokie,

Real basic shit to install:
make
mknod /dev/ltap2 c 40 0
insert the linspy2.o module into the kernel
use ltread2 to watch a tty

Thats all folks.

I will try to keep the latest version up on ftp://junker.org/pub/linspy/

This should compile against 2.2 kernels and glibc.

Well that's history
After all my friends ported to kernel 2.4 and I needed a toy I decided to 
improve Drago's linspy hope he won't mind -  his ftp is out of date
I hope it will be useful. 
any bugs flames etc send to xian@pgp.pl

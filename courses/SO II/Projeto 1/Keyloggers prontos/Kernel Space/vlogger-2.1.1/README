FEATURE

o Log keystrokes of all user sessions

	Console, serial console 
	Telnet/SSH remote sessions


o Stealth mechanism

	No syscall modifying, nearly impossible to detect
	UDP packets of log data can not be seen from the box itself


o Multiple logging modes and methods

	Support three logging modes
		Switch between logging modes by specific keys sequence
		Default toggle character is CTRL-]

	Dumb mode
		Logs all keystrokes

	Smart mode
		Ability to detect password prompt automatically to log only 
		sensitive data such as user/password (ssh, telnet, su, sudo, 
		ftp, ...)

	Normal mode 
		Stop logging mode


o Log methods

	Log to files
	
	Remote log over network
		Transmits log data via UDP to a specified machine

	System users neither see nor sniff log packets
		Sniffers such as tcpdump on the box can not see the traffic
		Bypass local network filtering/firewall rules


o Log data

	Separated logging for each tty/session
		Each tty has their own log buffer
		Easier to track sessions

	Timestamps logging

	Nearly support all special chars
		Arrow keys (left, right, up, down), Home, Page Up, Page Down
		F1 to F12, Shift+F1 to Shift+F12
